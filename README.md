# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

My Projects name is Softwear engineering project around the US. The main funciton of this project is to have adaptive design. This means that the webpage will react and adapt to different types of screen sized ranging from 1280 to 320 pixels in width. This specific page is for a social media page where you can share pictures of your travels around the US. There are quite a few different technologies at work but this includes using grid for spacing of the pictures and media queries to help the website adapte appropriately. The link to my Git Hub pages are here! https://github.com/Cole-Greenwald/se_project_aroundtheus as well as some screenshots of the page in images folder!
